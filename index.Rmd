# Introduction
In the world of e-commerce, optimizing the conversion rate is a paramount goal. A/B testing is a powerful tool that allows businesses to experiment with changes to their websites and product pages, enabling data-driven decisions for improved conversion rate. This case study presents an A/B test conducted for an ecommerce website to enhance its conversion rate.

## Background
- Business: XYZ Electronics

- Objective: To increase the conversion rate on the product page

- Duration: June 2023

## Hypothesis
The hypothesis for this A/B test is a change in the product page will result in a higher conversion rate. The change to be tested is an alternative design of the "Checkout page with", where the original design will be compared against the new design

## Test Duration
The test would last for more between 2 weeks to 4 weeks, during the month of January 2017.

# Data Understanding

## Data Collection/ Sourcing
The data was saved on a database, to be queried and imported into R.
**Importing the required libraries**
```{r load-libraries, message=FALSE}
# For connecting to PostgreSQL database
library(RPostgreSQL)

# For data manipulation and visualization
library(tidyverse)

# advanced themes for ggplot visualization
library(ggthemes)
```

**Connecting to the Database**
The code to connect to the database was excluded for privacy issues.
```{r connect-database, include=FALSE}
# Load Database Driver
drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL") #PostgreSQL Driver loaded

# Inserting PostgreSQL Credentials
conn <- dbConnect(drv,
                 dbname = "postgres",
                 host = "localhost",
                 port = "5432",
                 password = "cashmoney",
                 user = "postgres")
```

Next, we return a list of all the tables in the database so we can get the tables we will be needing for the test
```{r list-of-tables}
dbListTables(conn)
```

Query database to collect required data and preview the tables
```{r load-required-tables}
# load the tables
ab_data <- as_tibble(dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM ab_data"))
countries <- as_tibble(dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM countries"))

# preview the tables
head(ab_data)
head(countries)
```

## Data Structure and Data Manipulation
First we get the structure of both tables.
```{r data-structure}
str(ab_data)
str(countries)
```
The data frame ab_data is having `r dim(ab_data)[1]` rows and `r dim(ab_data)[2]` columns, while the countries data frame is having `r dim(countries)[1]` rows and `r dim(countries)[2]`` columns. Both data are related by user_id variable.


```{r join-data}
# join the data
ab_data_combined <- ab_data %>%
  left_join(countries, by = "user_id")
```

## Data Definition
- **user_id**: the unique identifier for each visitor in the dataset.

- **timestamp**: the date and time the user enter the page.

- **group**: category of the experiment to which users belong to.

- **landing page**: old or new page used for the analysis.

- **country**: the geographical location of the user.

## Variables
- Treatment indicators: landing page, group

- Response indicator: converted

# Data Analysis
## Randomization check
The first thing to do is to check if the randomization have been done properly and is equal between the treatments.
```{r frequency-preview}
table(ab_data_combined$group, ab_data_combined$landing_page)
```

There seems to be some data that has been misplaced, control group should be old_pages, treatment group should be new_pages.
Next we instigated which of the variables have been wrongly placed
```{r landing-page-sum}
colSums(table(ab_data_combined$group, ab_data_combined$landing_page))
```
The landing_page variable is correctly randomized.
```{r group-sum}
rowSums(table(ab_data_combined$group, ab_data_combined$landing_page))
```
The group variable is wrongly randomized and will be corrected.

### Fixing Randomization
```{r randomization-fix}
# replace wrongly placed control and treatment group
ab_data_combined <- ab_data_combined %>%
  mutate(group = ifelse(landing_page == "new_page", "treatment", "control"))

# check for correct randomization
table(ab_data_combined$group, ab_data_combined$landing_page)
```

The randomization has been fixed and the experiment can continue without issues
## Missing Data
After correcting the randomization, we check if there are missing in any of the column of the data frame.
```{r}
anyNA(ab_data_combined)
```
There are no missing data

## EDA
### Total number of responses
The total number of customers in the experiment are `r length(ab_data_combined$user_id)` from `r length(unique(ab_data_combined$country))` countries.

```{r}
ab_data_combined %>%
  ggplot(aes(group, fill = country))+
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("yellow4", "wheat4", "tan4"))+
  theme_minimal()+
  ggtitle("Frequency of Groups According to Countries")
  
```

### Frequency of Members That Converted
```{r}
ab_data_combined %>%
  filter(converted == 1) %>%
  ggplot(aes(country, fill = group))+
  geom_bar(position = "dodge2")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("tan4", "wheat4"))+
  labs(y = "Frequency",
       title = "Frequency of Converted Customer Across the Various Regions")+
  theme_minimal()
```


## Data Analysis
### Probability of Conversion for the Groups
```{r}
ab_data_combined %>%
  group_by(group, landing_page) %>%
  summarize(prob = sum(converted)/length(converted))
```
### Is the probability of being converted equal across landing page?
```{r}
prop.test(xtabs(~landing_page + converted, data = ab_data_combined)[, 2:1])
```
There are no differences across the landing page, and the probability of conversion is more or less the same as presented by the p-value

### Do conversion changes across the landing page
```{r}
t.test(converted~landing_page, data = ab_data_combined)
```
t-test shows that there is no significant difference between the landing pages as the confidence interval is close to zero for the means of both pages.

### Does conversion rate changes across Country Borders
```{r}
ab_data_combined %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(prob = sum(converted)/length(converted))
```
The probability of conversion seems to be similar across regions, but I will carry out a test to compare the 3 regions

### One Way Anova Test
```{r}
anova_test <- aov(converted ~ country, data = ab_data_combined)

summary(anova_test)
```

The p-value shows that that country does not an effect on the conversion rate of the store.
# Summary
While test and visuals has shown that there's no significant difference between the landing pages we can note that:
- the old page (mean conversion rate = 0.1205) is likely to convert more than the new page (mean conversion rate = 0.1188)

- A p-value of 0.1712 implies that there's a 17.12% probability of observing a difference as extreme as the one observed, but we can't take this as a significant difference as there isn't strong evidence to reject that the pages are having the same effect.

- Given preliminary test, there's no need to move on with the new_page, and saving cost is advisable here.

- Country do not also have an effect on the conversion rate.


# Conclusion and Recommendation
An AB Test was carried out to test if a new landing page should be implemented by an online store, to increase its conversion rate of its customers. After comparing the means, and test of significant, it is recommended to keep the old landing page as it is more effective than the new page, even if it doesn't really differ.
However, to save cost, it is advised to keep the old landing page
