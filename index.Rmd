# Introduction
In the world of e-commerce, optimizing the conversion rate is a paramount goal. A/B testing is a powerful tool that allows businesses to experiment with changes to their websites and product pages, enabling data-driven decisions for improved conversion rate. This case study presents an A/B test conducted for an ecommerce website to enhance its conversion rate.

## Background
- Business: XYZ Electronics

- Objective: To increase the conversion rate on the product page

- Duration: June 2023

## Hypothesis
The hypothesis for this A/B test is a change in the product page will result in a higher conversion rate. The change to be tested is an alternative design of the "Checkout page with", where the original design will be compared against the new design

## Test Duration
The test would last for more between 2 weeks to 4 weeks, during the month of January 2017.

# Data Understanding

## Data Collection/ Sourcing
The data was saved on a database, to be queried and imported into R.
**Importing the required libraries**
```{r load libraries}
# For connecting to PostgreSQL database
library(RPostgreSQL)

# For data manipulation and visualization
library(tidyverse)

# advanced themes for ggplot visualization
library(ggthemes)
```
**Connecting to the Database**
```{r}
# Load Database Driver
drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL") #PostgreSQL Driver loaded

# Inserting PostgreSQL Credentials
conn <- dbConnect(drv,
                 dbname = "postgres",
                 host = "localhost",
                 port = "5432",
                 password = "******",
                 user = "postgres")
```

Next, we return a list of all the tables in the database so we can get the tables we will be needing for the test
```{r list_of_tables}
dbListTables(conn)
```

Query database to collect required data and preview the tables
```{r load_required_tables}
# load the tables
ab_data <- as_tibble(dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM ab_data"))
countries <- as_tibble(dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM countries"))

# preview the tables
head(ab_data)
head(countries)
```

## Data Structure and Data Manipulation
First we get the structure of both tables.
```{r}
str(ab_data)
str(countries)
```
The data frame ab_data is having `r dim(ab_data)[1]` rows and `r dim(ab_data)[2]` columns, while the countries data frame is having `r dim(countries)[1]` rows and `r dim(countries)[2]`` columns. Both data are related by user_id variable.


```{r}
# join the data
ab_data_combined <- ab_data %>%
  left_join(countries, by = "user_id")
```

## Data Definition
- **user_id**: the unique identifier for each visitor in the dataset.

- **timestamp**: the date and time the user enter the page

- **group**: category of the experiment to which users belong to.

- **landing page**: old or new page used for the analysis.

- **country**: the geographical location of the user.

## Variables
- Treatment indicators: landing page, group

- Response indicator: converted


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```
